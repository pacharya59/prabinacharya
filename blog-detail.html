                            <p><strong>From Butwal to Bytes: My Journey from Nepal to IT</strong></p>
                            <p>Growing up in Butwal, a humble town nestled in southern Nepal, I lived a life many would call simple — but to me, it was full of dreams larger than the Himalayan sky. I come from a small, tight-knit family, where love was abundant, and expectations were high. My parents didn’t have much, but they poured every ounce of their hope into me. Not just to succeed, but to make meaning out of opportunity.</p>

                            <p><strong>A Short Poem: 🧒</strong><br>
                            In a clay-roofed home, with a secondhand phone,<br>
                            I dreamt of wires, not toys alone.<br>
                            A screw, a switch — I’d take apart,<br>
                            To see what gave machines their heart.<br>
                            While others played, I’d pry and peek,<br>
                            At gadgets old and circuits weak.<br>
                            That curious boy from a dusty street,<br>
                            Still guides my hands when systems greet.</p>

                            <p><strong>A Leap of Faith: From Nepal to Toronto 🎓</strong></p>
                            <p>My journey to Canada was more than just a flight across continents — it was a leap fueled by ambition, fear, and the relentless desire to build something greater. I arrived with a suitcase full of clothes, a head full of tech, and a heart filled with responsibility.</p>

                            <p>In 2022, I joined Seneca Polytechnic to pursue a diploma in Computer Systems Networking. It was a world of fast internet, real servers, modern labs, and a thousand things I had only read about on forums back home. Each class, each late-night lab, each moment of doubt — I reminded myself that I wasn’t just learning for myself. I was learning for my family, for my roots, and for the curious kid still living inside me.</p>

                            <p><strong>Always Fascinated by How Things Work 💻</strong></p>
                            <p>Since I was little, gadgets weren’t just tools — they were puzzles. I was the guy who opened the TV remote before knowing how to close it. Whether it was a Wi-Fi router, a mobile phone, or a misbehaving PC, I had to know why it worked, not just that it did.</p>

                            <p>That curiosity eventually turned into a skill — and that skill became a profession.</p>

                            <p>Today, as an IT Support Technician, I help others navigate their tech troubles with clarity, patience, and a deep respect for the systems I once dreamed about.</p>

                            <p><strong>Where I Am, and Where I’m Going 🌍</strong></p>
                            <p>Now based in Toronto, I work, learn, and continue to grow — not just as an IT professional, but as someone representing a family’s dream from Nepal. My journey is far from over. But with every system I fix, every server I configure, every user I support — I’m getting closer.</p>

                            <p>And I carry my story with pride — from the dusty roads of Butwal to the high-speed circuits of the digital world.</p>
